# Deployment Instructions

## âœ… All Deployment Fixes Applied Successfully

All 5 suggested deployment fixes have been implemented and verified:

### Fix 1: Explicit Run Command âœ…
- **Problem**: Run command was using `$file` variable which wasn't resolving properly
- **Solution**: Updated workflow to use explicit `python main_entrypoint.py`
- **Status**: COMPLETED - No more `$file` variable dependency

### Fix 2: Health Check Endpoints âœ…
- **Problem**: Application not responding to HTTP requests on root endpoint
- **Solution**: All health endpoints are working and verified
- **Verified Endpoints**:
  - `GET /` â†’ HTTP 200 - Text response: "Telegram Summarization Bot - Cloud Run Ready"
  - `GET /health` â†’ HTTP 200 - JSON health status with components
  - `GET /ready` â†’ HTTP 200 - JSON readiness probe for Cloud Run
  - `GET /status` â†’ HTTP 200 - JSON operational status with features
- **Status**: COMPLETED - All endpoints responding correctly

### Fix 3: Flask Dependency âœ…
- **Problem**: Flask dependency needed for HTTP server functionality
- **Solution**: Verified Flask >=3.0.0 is present in pyproject.toml
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Dependency properly configured

### Fix 4: Deployment Mode Configuration âœ…
- **Problem**: Need option for Reserved VM Background Worker vs Cloud Run
- **Solution**: Both deployment modes available:

#### Cloud Run Deployment (Current - Recommended)
- **Entry Point**: `python main_entrypoint.py`
- **Features**: HTTP server + Telegram bot
- **Port**: 5000
- **Health Checks**: All endpoints available
- **Use Case**: Production deployment with HTTP monitoring

#### Reserved VM Background Worker (Alternative)
- **Entry Point**: `python background_worker_config.py`
- **Features**: Telegram bot only (no HTTP server)
- **Environment**: Set `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE=background`
- **Use Case**: When HTTP endpoints are not needed

### Fix 5: Proper Polling Loop âœ…
- **Problem**: Ensure bot starts polling loop properly
- **Solution**: Async polling implemented with:
  - Graceful shutdown handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT)
  - Comprehensive error handling and recovery
  - Proper resource cleanup
  - Task cancellation on shutdown
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Bot active and processing messages

## Deployment Status

ðŸŸ¢ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

- All health check endpoints verified working
- HTTP server running on port 5000 with 0.0.0.0 binding
- Telegram bot active and operational
- Both Cloud Run and Background Worker modes available
- All deployment issues resolved

## Deployment Commands

### Current Setup (Cloud Run)
```bash
python main_entrypoint.py
```

### Alternative (Background Worker)
```bash
DEPLOYMENT_TYPE=background python background_worker_config.py
```

## Environment Variables Required

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Required - Telegram bot authentication
- `GROQ_API_KEY`: Optional - Enables AI summarization (fallback available)
- `PORT`: Optional - HTTP server port (defaults to 5000)
- `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE`: Optional - Set to 'background' for worker mode

## Health Check Verification

All endpoints tested and confirmed working:

```bash
# Root endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/
# Response: "Telegram Summarization Bot - Cloud Run Ready"

# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health
# Response: JSON with status, components, and health info

# Readiness probe
curl http://localhost:5000/ready
# Response: JSON with readiness status

# Status endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/status
# Response: JSON with service status and features
```

## Deployment is Ready! ðŸš€

The application has been successfully fixed and is ready for Cloud Run deployment. All the issues mentioned in the deployment failure have been resolved.
