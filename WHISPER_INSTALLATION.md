# Whisper Installation Guide

## Current Status
✅ **Audio processing pipeline is fully functional**

✅ **FFmpeg conversion working**
✅ **Fallback system provides informative messages**
⚠️ **Whisper transcription pending installation**

## What Works Now

- ✅ Format conversion to WAV 16kHz mono
- ✅ Audio segmentation (8 segments for processing)
- ✅ Duration calculation and file info
- ✅ Integration with Groq/Llama summarization
- ✅ Informative fallback messages

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Manual Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# In the Replit Shell
pip install openai-whisper
```

### Option 2: Alternative Whisper Implementation
```bash
# Faster, lighter alternative
pip install faster-whisper
```

### Option 3: System-level Installation
```bash
# If pip fails, try system installation
apt update
apt install python3-openai-whisper
```

## After Installation
Once Whisper is installed, the bot will automatically:
1. Detect available Whisper models
2. Download base model on first use (~150MB)
3. Provide full speech-to-text transcription
4. Support 99 languages with auto-detection
5. Generate precise summaries from transcribed content

## Verification
Test installation with:
```python
import whisper
print("Whisper installed successfully!")
```

## Current Fallback Behavior
Without Whisper, the bot:
- ✅ Processes audio files correctly
- ✅ Shows duration and technical info
- ✅ Provides installation instructions
- ✅ Maintains full functionality for other content types

## Technical Notes
- Base model (whisper-base) recommended for balance of speed/accuracy
- Small model (~40MB) for faster processing
- Large model (~1.5GB) for maximum accuracy
- Audio automatically chunked for processing efficiency
